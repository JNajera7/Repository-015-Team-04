Minutes of Meeting - 04_05.txt

We started off the meeting with the confirmation that all of our docker files are set up, as well as the entire skeleton in VsCode. 
We then reviewed what each of us completed within the last week.  we have completed the navBar, creating a logo for the site and editing 
the layout of the login page. Jesus worked on the registration page, as well as the clear closet function and the logout/delete 
account functions. Also we made the barebones page for saved pieces. In addition we edited the homepage layout,and added the 
weather widget to homepage. The login and registration pages were the main focus, including a ReGex application for the password 
creation requirements. The team manger emphasized that we should complete all of the project requirements first, before implementing
any additional features to our website. He suggested that we should assign any unfinished requirements to specific people, as opposed to one
person completing each feature at their own pace. There was also mention of cleaning up the database storage, for the ease of our readability.
We all agreed we would clean up the css formatting for every page. The team manager also suggested that after we finish the requirements,
complete at least a few of the optional requirements, again, before implementing our own additional site features (ex. scanning clothing).
There was discussion about the unit test case error we were having an issue with as well, and ways we could overcome it.

Spend less time deciding what to wear and let the Wardrobe Wizard decide for you!

With our different functions, you’ll never have to worry about wasting time by trying on different outfits to find the perfect one. You will be able to preview outfits within the application with the click of a button. 

If you’re indecisive, we have a daily outfit recommendation for any occasion: casual, date nights, business/formal, beachwear, loungewear, and athleticwear. Your casual suggestion will also take the weather into account. Additionally, you can just pre-save an outfit: pick out the pieces that comprise it, and then add it to your saved outfits. Every piece of your clothing, and every outfit you save, is all saved within our database. Thus, if you connect from a different device or log in later, you won’t have to start your closet and outfits from scratch again.

If you’re looking for something wild, look no further than the outfit randomization. With our outfit randomizing function, you can shuffle the whole outfit, or just mix up one aspect — be it a shirt or random shoes. But don’t worry about the outfit being inadequate for the weather; we’ll make sure any recommendations are weather appropriate (barring the beachwear).
